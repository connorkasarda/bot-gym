# Badges
The robotics skill tree allows students to explore the potential of robots through engaging challenges and fun games.  Badges are ranked by difficulty to ensure a healthy progression towards robotics proficiency; just like a skill tree from a video game, the "player" will start with challenges rated low in complexity and continue working their way up to higher complexity.

## Priorities
- **Level[0]:** Intro -- firmware and hardware
- **Level[1]:** Kinematics -- games that teach motors and movement 
- **Level[2]:** Sensory -- games that teach digital and analog sensors
- **Level[3]:** Automata -- games that require the robot to make decisions
- **Level[4]:** Challenges -- games that test students knowledge of robotics
