# Robotics Curriculum
The curriculum utilizes a skill tree and badges, allowing students to explore the potential of robots through engaging challenges and fun games.  Badges are ranked by difficulty to ensure a healthy progression towards robotics proficiency; just like a skill tree from a video game, the "player" will start with challenges rated low in complexity and continue working their way up to higher complexity.

## Level Up System

The level up system provides a sense of progression for the robotics student as they explore the plentiful world of robotics and programming.  Below is a list of the steps, or "levels", each student will take when enrolled in the robotics academy.

```
for index, level in enumerate(curriculum):
    print(index, '-->', level)
```

```
0 --> Demo  
1 --> Firmware & Hardware  
2 --> Kinematics  
3 --> Sensory  
4 --> Sequences  
5 --> Algorithms  
6 --> Optimization  
7 --> Exploration  
```

We explore each of these levels from the robotics curriculum in detail, revealing the inner workings of a learning experience that aims to drive curiosity and inspire students through a variety of games and activities that are rewarding and fun.

## Demo: First Impression is Everything!

With an exposure to pre-built and pre-programmed demo robots, students get to witness the amazing capabilities of robots and have their questions answered. Here are a few examples, among many...

```
for query in robot_questions:
    print(query)
```

```
What are robots?  
How do robots think?  
What can I do with robots?  
```
