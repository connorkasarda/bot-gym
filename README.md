# Robot Gym
Fun testing environment for virtual, simulated robots

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Robot has a simple cube appearance and is equipped with human controls so that puzzles are solved manually
- [ ] Robot still composed of a simple cube but is now equipped with a "brain" so that puzzles are solved automatically
- [ ] Robot gains a second "brain": the first "brain" controls the robot to solve puzzles while the second "brain" constructs robot with soft "voxel" units
  - [ ] Soft-body dynamics calculations (pressure spring-mass system)

## Research
- NEAT Algorithm
- Soft Robots
