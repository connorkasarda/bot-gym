# Robot Gym: Simulator
***End Goal:*** Simulates robots as a virtual entity within a virtual environment.  This is a **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML** project meant to be run in a web browser.  Robots could be defined by a human or AI.  Additionally, the robots could be piloted by a human or AI.  Scenes will be created by a human, testing the robots abilities to complete those tasks.

## Design Choices
- [x] This project will be constructed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
- [x] Decide what functionalities are created from scratch or derived from libraries (ex: collision detection, neural networks, etc.)
  - [x] 3D Graphics: ***three.js***
  - [x] Physics: ***ammo.js***

## Milestones
- [x] Create simple interface and graphics as a first step
- [ ] Implement physics engine for environment conditions and virtual robot interactions
- [ ] Try out AI and ML coding, as well as neural networks, for virtual robot behaviors and designs
