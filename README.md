# Bot Gym: Robot Simulator
***End Goal:*** Emulates robots as a virtual entity within a virtual environment.  A physics engine will be created to aid the simulator, providing physical laws for the robots to follow.  Robots could be defined by a human or AI.  Additionally, the robots could be piloted by a human or AI.  Scenes could be created, testing the robots abilities to complete those tasks.
