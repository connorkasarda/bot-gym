# Bot Gym: Robot Simulator
***End Goal:*** Emulates robots as a virtual entity within a virtual environment.  A physics engine will be created to aid the simulator, providing physical laws for the robots to follow.  Robots could be defined by a human or AI.  Additionally, the robots could be piloted by a human or AI.  Scenes could be created, testing the robots abilities to complete those tasks.

## Milestones
- [ ] Play with OpenGL for graphics
- [ ] Construct physics engine for environment conditions and virtual robot interactions
- [ ] Try out AI and ML coding, as well as neural networks, for virtual robot behaviors

## Learning
- [ ] Read *High-Performance Python* book and see if this proves that Python can be used over C++
- [ ] Read *Make Your Own Neural Network* to learn about coding neural networks from scratch
- [ ] If using C++, perhaps use Visual Studio instead of VS Code and learn how to use CMAKE for the time being
