# Robot Gym: Simulator
***End Goal:*** Simulates robots as a virtual entity within a virtual environment.  This is a **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML** project meant to be run in a web browser.  A physics engine will be created to aid the simulator, providing physical laws for the robots to follow.  Robots could be defined by a human or AI.  Additionally, the robots could be piloted by a human or AI.  Scenes could be created, testing the robots abilities to complete those tasks.

## Design Choices
- [x] This project will be constructed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## Milestones
- [ ] Create simple interface and graphics as a first step
- [ ] Construct physics engine for environment conditions and virtual robot interactions
- [ ] Try out AI and ML coding, as well as neural networks, for virtual robot behaviors and designs

## Learning
- [ ] JavaScript, CSS, and HTML syntax and coding
- [ ] Read *High-Performance Python* book and see if this proves that Python can be used over C++
- [ ] Read *Make Your Own Neural Network* to learn about coding neural networks from scratch
- [ ] If using C++, perhaps use Visual Studio instead of VS Code and learn how to use CMAKE for the time being
